	In the meadows surrounding London, in the late 1800s, there lay a young __boy__ named __Hunter__ contemplating a scene that
 was playing out in front of the tree he sat upon. The spectacle he beheld was a(n) __tall__ woman under scrutiny for something that he could 
not quite make out. Recognizing the woman as his childhood nanny, young __Hunter__ sprang to his feet and approached the scene
 __wrestlessly__. He knew not yet what he would say in defense of his previous caretaker, for he did not know whether she was guilty or not,
 however he felt a stong urge welling up in his throat, ready to burst from his vocal chords.
	 "_Stop_!" he yelled to the __large__ group of men surrounding his old friend. Puzzled, they turned to face young __Hunter__ with his chest out, standing more confidently than a __lion__. An eruption of __noise__ came from the men as they
observed our young hero, standing up for his old friend. Then an old voice came from amongst the men and silence fell over them. 
	"__Hunter__" the woman said. "I am guilty. I am guilty of __murder__. One day I was in the town and I felt the urge to __kill__. Now as you know this is punishable by __Death__. However, if you will testify on my behalf, I may be relieved of this
 charge. What say you?"
	Following a moment of contemplation, __Hunter__ simply replied, "__I don't know__."
